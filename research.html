Currently I am working on the <i> generalization ability of deep neural networks,</i> trying to answer why deep learning works so well in real world problems. In particular, I study the generalization of <i> convolutional neural networks (CNN) </i> on some high dimensional generative models, such as <i> generative adversarial nets (GAN).</i> In addition to machine learning, I am also interested in some emerging issues of data science, including <i> data anonymity </i> or <i> privacy </i>. For instance, I have studied the fundamental limits of anonymous detection or inference, with application in crowdsourced machine learning or sensor networks.
