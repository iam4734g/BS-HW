Hi, 我是陳奕丞， currently serving in the military as a private. I will start my PhD study at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) since 2019 Fall. I received my master degree from [_Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering_](https://comm.ntu.edu.tw/), [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) under the supervision of professor [_I-Hsiang Wang_](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~ihsiangw/). Prior to my master study, I received my Bachelor degree in [_Electric Engineering_](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/en/) and [_Mathematics_](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/en) (dual degree) at National Taiwan University, June, 2016.

 
My research interests focus on information-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of data science. Currently I am studying on the _generalization ability of deep neural networks,_ trying to answer why deep learning works so well in real world problems. My research adopts tools mainly from _information theory_, _machine learning_ and _statistical inference_.

Due to my service, I may not be able to respond mails instantly, but I will try to handle them in weekend. If I don't reply in a week, please remind me again!
<!--I am planing to apply for a PhD program in EE/ECE. If you are seeking for PhD students or knowing someone who does, please feel free to contact me! You can find my full CV [_here_](/data/WNChen_cv.pdf).-->
