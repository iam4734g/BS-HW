Consider the problem of anonymous parameter estimation with $n$ samples drawn from $K$ independent but non-identical sources. The key challenge is the anonymity of samples -- they are passed through an unknown permutation $\pi$ before the fusion center observing them, making identifying the underlying distribution of individual sample difficult. We aim to find an estimator which minimizes the worst-case (possible permutation) mean square error (MSE) and to specify the asymptotic Fisher information as $n$ tends to infinity, assuming the number of samples from each source is proportional to $n$. 
Our results are two-fold: we showed that the optimal estimator depends only on the empirical distribution of samples, and we also explicitly characterized how anonymity decreases the Fisher information.
