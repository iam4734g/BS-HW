We explore the fundamental limits of heterogeneous distributed detection in an anonymous sensor network with $n$ sensors and a single fusion center. The fusion center collects the single observation from each of the $n$ sensors to detect a binary parameter. The sensors are clustered into multiple groups, and different groups follow different distributions under a given hypothesis. The key challenge for the fusion center is the anonymity of sensors -- although it knows the exact number of sensors and the distribution of observations in each group, it does not know which group each sensor belongs to. It is hence natural to consider it as a composite hypothesis testing problem. 

Our results elucidate the price of anonymity in heterogeneous distributed detection, and can be extended to M-ary hypothesis testing with heterogeneous observations generated according to hidden latent variables. The results are also applied to distributed detection under Byzantine attacks, which hints that the conventional approach based on simple hypothesis testing might be too pessimistic.
